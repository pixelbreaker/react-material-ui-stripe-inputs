# react-material-stripe-inputs

This library is designed to take some of the pain out of wrapping Stripe's `react-stripe-elements` inside FormControls that are part of `material-ui`

## Development
Run `yarn` to install all dependencies locally

To work in development use `yarn storybook` and edit stories in `/stories`
